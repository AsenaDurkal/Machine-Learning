In this project, I utilized the Statlog (German Credit Data), accessible via the following link: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/144/statlog+german+credit+data

The primary objective of this project is to develop an application leveraging artificial intelligence for a classification task.
Specifically, the application is designed to predict the likelihood of a customer being approved for a loan. Users input customer data into the application, and in response,
receive information regarding the probability of loan approval for the given customer.
